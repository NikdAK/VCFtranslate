number of unique mutations = 4
note: these are unique genomic mutation sites, so the same mutation for multiple transcripts = 1 mutation (RNA+exome combined)


with these mutation called by:
4


with the mutation classes distributed like:
frameshift_variant 1
non_coding_transcript_exon_variant 1
splice_donor_variant&intron_variant 1
stop_gained 1
note: mutation sites with overlapping genes/transcripts can have multiple classes, which are combined with +++


with the mutation types distributed like:
substitution 3
insertion 1
note: mutation sites with overlapping genes/transcripts can have multiple types, which are combined with +++
note: 1 genomic position can have multiple different mutations, e.g. G>A and GG>AA with different amino acid changes


number of affected genes = 4

note: one mutation can affect multiple transcripts/genes (genomic overlaps)
note: one transcript/gene can have multiple mutations
